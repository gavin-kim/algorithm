#Algorithm
`big O: an upper bound (The worst case). It won't be slower than runtimes.`<br>
`big omega: an lower bound (The best case). It won't be faster than those runtimes.`<br>
`big theta: both O and 0. That is, an algorithm is 0(N) if it is both O(N) and 0( N). 0 gives a tight bound on runtime.`<br>
