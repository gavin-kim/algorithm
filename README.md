#Algorithm

<h4>In industry, People merge Big theta and Big O together. Industry's meaning of big O is <strong>big theta</strong></h4>
<h4>There is NO relationship between best/worst/expected case and big 0/theta/omega</h4>

`big O: an upper bound. It won't be slower than runtimes.`<br>
`big omega: an lower bound. It won't be faster than those runtimes.`<br>
`big theta: both O and omega. An algorithm is 0(N) if it is both Big O(N) and Big omega(N). 0 gives a tight bound on runtime.`<br>
