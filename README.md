#Algorithm

<h4>
Best, worst, and expected cases describe the big O (or big theta) time for particular inputs or scenarios.<br>
Big O, big omega, and big theta describe the upper, lower, and tight bounds for the runtime.
</h4>

`Big O: an upper bound. It won't be slower than runtimes.`<br>
`Big omega: an lower bound. It won't be faster than those runtimes.`<br>
`Big theta: both O and omega. An algorithm is 0(N) if it is both Big O(N) and Big omega(N). 0 gives a tight bound on runtime.`<br>

<h4>
Industry's meaning of Big O is Big theta<br>
There is NO relationship between best/worst/expected case and big 0/theta/omega<br>
