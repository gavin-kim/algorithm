# AVL tree

* AVL tree is a balanced binary search tree. Each node has height. 
* The height of a node is `1 + Height of its children nodes`. The height of a node having no child is 0.
* If a tree is perfectly balanced, its height is log n.
* Tree needs to be balanced whenever a node is added or deleted.
