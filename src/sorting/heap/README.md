# Heap Sort 
<h4>HeapSort has poor cache performance: array entries are rarely compared with nearby array
entries, so the number of cache misses is far higher than for quicksort, mergesort, and
even shellsort, where most compares are with nearby entries.</h4>

<h4>Heap always starts with index 1, Heap that has size N is filled with 1 ~ N elements. <br>
In a heap, A parent of node is in  position k, 2 children nodes are in position 2k and 2k + 1.<br>
The height of a complete binary tree of size N is logN and increases by 1 when N is a power of 2.</h4>
