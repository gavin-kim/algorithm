# Distribution Sorts
<h4>
     Counting: buckets hold only a single value <br>
     Bucket:   buckets hold a range of values <br>
     Radix:    buckets hold values based on digits within their values <br>
               (w = the number of bits for max value in the array,<br>
                d = the number of bits to be used for counting sort each time)<br>
</h4>
<h4>
  Comparison sorts can't run better than O(n log n) but Distribution sorts run in linear time O(n)<br>
  The unique characteristic of a distribution sorting algorithm is  that it does not make use of comparisons to do the sorting.
