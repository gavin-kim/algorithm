# Graph

<strong>Application of DFS and BFS</strong><br>
<ol>
<li>Finding a path between two vertices.</li>
<li>Checking whether all vertex is connected in the graph.</li>
<li>Finding a cycle in the graph</li>
</ol>
<strong>Application of the DFS</strong><br>
<ol>
<li>Finding a Hamiltonian path (Hamiltonian path is a path that visits each vertex exactly once)</li>
</ol>
<strong>Application of the BFS</strong><br>
<ol>
<li>Finding a shortest path between two vertices.</li>
<li>Checking whether a graph is bipartite (A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into 2 sets)
