# Graph

Application of DFS and BFS
1. Finding a path between two vertices.
2. Checking whether all vertex is connected in the graph.
3. Finding a cycle in the graph

Application of the DFS
1. Finding a Hamiltonian path (Hamiltonian path is a path that visits each vertex exactly once)

Application of the BFS
1. Finding a shortest path between two vertices.
2. Checking whether a graph is bipartite (A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into 2 sets)
